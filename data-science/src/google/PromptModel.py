        "Behavior Analysis: Note behaviors like repeatedly entering and exiting the store without purchases, or carrying fuller bags after visiting the store.",
        "Pay special attention to customers who take items and do not head towards the checkout counters, as this could indicate an intent to shoplift.",
        "Situation Assessment: Combine the observed details to assess whether these behaviors cumulatively suggest a potential for shoplifting.",
        "Reporting: Describe in detail the specific behaviors, the exact locations within the store, and articulate why these actions may suggest potential shoplifting.",
        "Ensure that your report is polite and professional, focusing on behavior rather than personal attributes to avoid bias and false accusations.",
        "Each step should guide you through the task, making it easier to process complex information and make accurate judgments.",
        "This structured approach will help you enhance your observational techniques, distinguishing effectively between normal customer behavior and potential security risks.",
        "Your prompts should be clear, instructive, and carefully designed to assist the cv_model in processing and reporting information efficiently, by breaking complex observations into smaller analytical tasks.",
        "Each prompt should refine the cv_model's ability to observe and evaluate with precision."
