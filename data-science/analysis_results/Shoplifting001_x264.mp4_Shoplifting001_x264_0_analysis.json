One is near the shelves on the right, appearing to inspect merchandise. The other is further back, walking toward the aisle. No visible signs of item concealment or interaction with security tags.\n  \n- **Frame 2 (04:14:50 PM):** \n  - The individual near the shelves continues to appear focused on the merchandise. The second individual is closer to the aisle but does not seem to interact with any items. No suspicious behavior is evident.\n\n- **Frame 3 (04:14:51 PM):** \n  - The individual near the shelves seems to reposition slightly, potentially to reach for an item. The second individual remains stationary, observing the aisle or the surroundings. No clear signs of concealment or nervous behavior.\n\n- **Frame 4 (04:14:51 PM):** \n  - Both individuals remain in similar positions as the previous frame. The individual near the shelves does not exhibit any behavior suggesting item concealment or tampering with tags.\n\n- **Frame 5 (04:14:52 PM):** \n  - The individual near the shelves shifts position, potentially to inspect another item. The second individual moves slightly but remains distant from the shelves. No visible signs of coordination or distraction tactics.\n\n- **Frame 6 (04:14:52 PM):** \n  - The individual near the shelves continues to examine merchandise. The second individual begins to walk toward the aisle, still without interacting with items or displaying nervous behavior.\n\n- **Frame 7 (04:14:53 PM):** \n  - The individual near the shelves remains stationary, likely still inspecting items. The second individual appears to move past the aisle. No signs of suspicious behavior or accomplice activity.\n\n- **Frame 8 (04:14:53 PM):** \n  - Both individuals remain in the frame, but their actions do not suggest shoplifting. The individual near the shelves does not appear to conceal items, and the second individual is walking away from the aisle.\n\n---\n\n#### 2. **Patterns of Behavior:**\n- The individual closest to the shelves displays normal shopping behavior, such as inspecting merchandise and repositioning slightly to reach items.\n- The second individual moves through the aisle but does not interact with items or display behaviors associated with shoplifting (e.g., nervousness, concealment, or distraction tactics).\n- There is no indication of coordination between the two individuals to distract staff or execute theft.\n\n---\n\n#### 3. **Conclusion:**\n- **Shoplifting Determination:** There is no evidence of shoplifting occurring in these frames.\n- **Confidence Level:** 95% (based on the absence of suspicious behaviors such as item concealment, security tag removal, checkout avoidance, nervousness, or accomplice activity).\n- **Key Behaviors Supporting Conclusion:** \n  - Normal shopping actions observed: inspecting merchandise, moving through the aisle without interaction.\n  - No visible signs of concealment or tampering with items.\n  - Lack of coordinated behavior between the individuals.\n\n"
